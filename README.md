# Customized HTML Audio Player

This repository contains a modified version of the HTML audio player, enhanced with custom styling and functionality.

## Features

- **Automatic Playback:** The audio file starts playing automatically on page load.
- **Custom Controls:** The original player is hidden (`display: none`), and its content is displayed within custom HTML elements.
- **Replay Button:** Replaces the play button with a replay button.
- **Responsive Design:** The player is designed to be responsive, with a maximum width of 400px.

## Usage

To use this customized audio player, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary dependencies in your HTML file:

   ```html
   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="modified-player.css">
   ```

2. Add the player HTML structure to your document body:

   ```html
   <div class="audio-player">
     <!-- ... (player content) ... -->
   </div>
   ```

3. Include the JavaScript file for the player:

   ```html
   <script src="modified-player.js"></script>
   ```

4. Additionally, include Font Awesome for the icon used in the replay button:

   ```html
   <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/b5983e4169.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
   ```

5. Customize the `src` attribute of the audio element to point to your desired audio file:

   ```html
   <source src="your-audio-file.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
   ```

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the player by modifying the styles in the `modified-player.css` file. Adjust the width, colors, or any other styles to match your website's design.

## Functionality

The replay button serves a dual purpose:

- If the audio is not currently playing, clicking the replay button will start playback.
- If the audio is already playing, clicking the replay button will reset the playback to the beginning.
